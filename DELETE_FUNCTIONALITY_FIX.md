# Delete Media Functionality Fix

## Issue Description

The delete media button was not deleting files from R2 storage. Users could delete files from the frontend, but the actual files remained in the R2 bucket.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Frontend Using Debug Endpoints
The frontend was calling debug endpoints instead of proper delete endpoints:
- `useDeleteUpload` was calling `/uploads/debug/test-delete` (POST)
- `useBulkDeleteUpload` was calling `/uploads/debug/bulk-delete` (POST)

### 2. Improper URL Key Extraction
The `extractKeyFromUrl` method in R2Service was too simplistic and might not have been correctly extracting the file key from CDN URLs.

### 3. Missing Proper Bulk Delete Endpoint
There was no proper bulk delete endpoint, only a debug endpoint.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Frontend Endpoints

#### Updated `useDeleteUpload` Hook
- Changed from `/uploads/debug/test-delete` (POST) to `/uploads/by-url` (DELETE)
- Now uses proper RESTful DELETE method

#### Updated `useBulkDeleteUpload` Hook
- Changed from `/uploads/debug/bulk-delete` (POST) to `/uploads/bulk-delete` (POST)
- Now uses the new proper bulk delete endpoint

### 2. Enhanced R2Service Delete Functionality

#### Improved `extractKeyFromUrl` Method
- Added proper URL parsing logic
- Added logging to track key extraction
- Handles CDN URLs correctly

#### Enhanced `deleteFile` Method
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Better error handling and reporting
- Tracks the entire deletion process

### 3. Added Proper Bulk Delete Endpoint

#### New `/uploads/bulk-delete` Endpoint
- Replaces the debug endpoint
- Proper error handling
- Returns structured response with success/failure counts

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
- `nest-backend/src/features/upload/r2.service.ts` - Enhanced delete functionality and logging
- `nest-backend/src/features/upload/upload.controller.ts` - Added proper bulk delete endpoint

### Frontend Changes
- `next-frontend/app/_services/hooks/upload/use-delete-upload.ts` - Updated to use proper delete endpoint
- `next-frontend/app/_services/hooks/upload/use-bulk-delete-upload.ts` - Updated to use proper bulk delete endpoint

### Test Files
- `nest-backend/test-delete-functionality.js` - Test script to verify delete functionality

## Testing

### 1. Test Individual File Deletion
```bash
# Test the delete functionality
node test-delete-functionality.js
```

### 2. Test Frontend Delete
- Upload a new file
- Click the delete button
- Verify the file is removed from both frontend and R2

### 3. Test Bulk Delete
- Upload multiple files
- Click "Clear All"
- Verify all files are removed from both frontend and R2

## Monitoring

The system now includes comprehensive logging for delete operations:
- R2Service logs the entire deletion process
- Key extraction is logged for debugging
- Error details are captured and logged

## API Endpoints

### Individual Delete
```
DELETE /uploads/by-url
Body: { fileUrl: string }
```

### Bulk Delete
```
POST /uploads/bulk-delete
Body: { fileUrls: string[] }
Response: { success: boolean, message: string, results: object }
```

## Prevention

This fix ensures that:
- Proper RESTful endpoints are used for delete operations
- File keys are correctly extracted from CDN URLs
- Comprehensive logging helps debug future issues
- Both individual and bulk delete operations work correctly
